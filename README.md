# Data-Visualization-Projects-with-d3.js
This project aims to create visual representations of data using various types of graphs and charts. The project will cover five main tasks: visualizing data with a bar chart, a scatter plot graph, a heat map, a choropleth map, and a tree map diagram. Each task will provide insights into the data through intuitive and informative visualizations.
